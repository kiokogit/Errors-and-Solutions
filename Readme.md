Now, in this project, I will probably in build a good-looking app to show what I only intended as a simple read me tracker of my coding progress daily;

Since this idea comes more than 4 months after my first git push command, I'll start with some history of what I have learnt so far.

Forget the philosophy of how many hours I should code, or how many docs I should read before executing a command. Lets talk code:

September 2021:
 it was all about basic syntax of Javascript, a wholly new language to me. I even studied how to use Vscode. And 'What is the difference between git and github'

Nov 2021:
    This was a time for max reading of many docs of express, react, mongodb, and all there is in node. Of course not all.
    To help that, started on a short Library system project - a full MERN Stack project at end of Nov

Dec 2021:
    Project almost done; biggest hurdle for the Library System: Authentication of users, and verification of users. If you've come across nodejs, and have met django on your way, you'll find with node, you code it, with django you apply it. Coding it is still helping.
Jan 2022:
    Happy new year? Well. pip install Jan. I started on learning python and django. Oh, I first did a heroku deployment of my two apps - backend and frontend. They were working perfectly, until I deployed on heroku, and realized there was a lot I still had to do. 
    Main headache: CORS. cross-origin-Resource-Sharing policy does not just allow my apps to share everything.

    Today its 25th Jan 2022, and CORS is still a problem, even after adding headers, app.use(cors()), etc. But one thing is real pinching: my mongodb atlas connection is not yet successful since early Jan.

So:
I have realized that I have lots of little solutions that I come across in every problem I meet on the way. And it would help me a lot to keep tabs of the issues and the solutions here. 
        Through craeting lots of non-executable files full of random code snippets to illustrate the points. If I will in the end build a good progress tracker, gracias. Until then, Lts talk code. 
    From here on, its a form of a diary.

Lets talk Code.

25th Jan:
Working on the MVT model with django, trying to use different databases - MongoDb

26th 
Has been all about authentication and denying permissions to non-auths
see django-rest-auth.py

Today is some day in March, 15th. I have been working on a project that was inspired by this error marking code project, that ended up being larger than I thought. THis is just what happens when you work on a project withut a proper map.

So here, First, the link to the apps are: https://github.com/kiokogit/myShelfClient.git and https://github.com/kiokogit/myShelfBackEnd.git

Now, there is something I found out: 
THere is a file type that can change language from one language to another, using the back ticks. THis .md file

for Javascript, set as below:
```js
const codeTest=(why) =>{
    return
}
```
for python, 
```py
def impl_code(smart):
    if smart is not None:
        pass
    return None
```
etc. So now I will be creating .md files for the errors
